# Let's Recreate Agar.IO

In the real workplace, you'll be asked to read a tech spec and implement code. Your assignment is to do so with the following tech spec. Good luck!

---

# Recreate Agar.IO Tech Spec

## Summary
_The **Summary** section summarizes the goal._

Agar.IO is fun and gets fairly complex. You will be implementing a simple version of it.

## Context
_The **Context** section tells us why we are doing what we are doing and what we have already done to build upon our goals._

The next step is to create a one of the Agar.IO to prove to yourself you have learned. There will be no help or hints, just you and the universe. You should reflect on your *accomplishments* and take inspiration from the concepts and tools from this project. You can [play Agar.IO here](https://www.miniclip.com/games/agar-io/en/) to understand the basic mechanics.

## Goals
_The **Goals** section outlines the objectives of this tech spec before we consider the project complete. This is also known as **Acceptance Criteria**_

- Create a blob that gets bigger when it eats food
- Allow the blob to move around based on user controls
- Periodically generate food around the blob
- The blob will grow smaller as it waits or moves around
- The blob dies when it gets too small and turns grey

## Non-Goals
_The **Non-Goals** section help confine the scope of the project so that we do not over-shoot and implement things that may not be used._

- Making the camera center around the blob
- Create enemies that you can eat and can eat you

## Plan
_The **Plan** section describes roughly how the goals should be accomplished and documents how things should work._

We will use HTML canvas and create this game with JavaScript. The following are classes that will help shape the mechanics and world-building of the game.

### Game
```
  Attributes:
    objects - contains the blob and the food
    foodGenRate - how many foods should be generated per time unit
  Methods:
    render() - remove destroyed objects and invokes draw on each objects
    generateFood() - adds foods to its object attribute periodically
    garbageCollect() - removes destroyed objects so they do not take up memory
```

Read more about [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science))

### Circle
```
  Attributes:
    size - size of the circle
    color - color of the circle
    destroyed - a boolean that indicates the object should no longer be drawn and be removed from the objects attribute
  Methods:
    draw() - draws the blob onto the canvas
```

### Blob
```
  Parent Class:
    Circle
  Attributes:
    size - how big the blob is visually
    metabolicRate - how fast the size decreases
    velocity - how fast it can move
    position - where it is on the canvas
    direction - where it is going towards
  Methods:
    eat(obj) - takes an object as a parameter
      1. Checks if the object can be eaten
      1. Checks collision with the object
      1. Mark the object as destroyed
    metabolize() - decreases size based on metabolicRate, when it is too small, it turns grey and stops metabolizing
    updatePosition() - update the position of the object
```

Read more about [parent class](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_class_extends.asp)

### Food
```
  Parent Class:
    Circle
  Attributes:
    canBeEaten - a boolean that indicates the object can be eaten
```

---

### Controls

- Make the blob follow the mouse by changing its direction towards the mouse

### Generating Food

- Generate foods at random spots at a given rate

Hint: You may want to use [setInterval()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp)

## Security
_The **Security** section does not apply to this project. In general, it highlights security risks and how we can mitigate them. we must think as attackers to break, steal, and monitor our victims, and as defenders, to frustrate attackers._

## Scalability
_The **Scalability** section also does not apply to this project. In general, scalability is determined by the anticipated utility with margins and limited by performance characteristics. This is a good place to include graphs to prove that this tech spec proposal can scale._

## Other Considerations
_The **Other Considerations** section consist of ideas that we thought about but decided not to go with. It shows that we have thought about these ideas and help answer questions that may arise in the **Discussion** section._

- I decided not to ask you to create this document yourself as it may be too difficult. I will be more hands off as you gain more skills, experience and confidence.
- We will not yet simulate other parts of the development process here because that requires more set up and it distracts from the assignment itself.

## Discussion
_The **Discussion** section allows collaborators to ask for clarification and/or make suggestions. This will help shape and clean up the whole tech spec. I will prompt you and your peer to start Dropbox documents in upcoming projects. Instead of this section, we can leverage the annotation feature in these documents._

# Staying Organized

This is not a small project by any means, especially for a beginner. We will be using GitHub for version control and project management to help us stay organized.

## Version Control

_Version Control_ is a concept to help organize code changes in a collaborative environment. You want to know the exact version of the code that people are running when they use your app. You may have changes that is not done and it's responsible to deploy these changes only when they are complete and tested. You may want to see your code from a few days ago to understand why something did or didn't work. There are many more reasons. There is no need to memorize the reasons as you will learn them through experience with this course.

You do not want broken code out in the streets.
{: .notice}

## Project Management

You should know about _Project Management_ even though you are not a project manager because this is a system that helps you manage expectations and improve collaboration.

---

## Challenge 1: Maintain your code online

### Setup GitHub

1. Sign up for an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

### Create a Repository

1. Create a [New Repository](https://github.com/new) and name it `agar-io`
1. Copy the repository URL by clicking on the copy icon. It should look like this:
```
https://github.com/<your_username>/agar-io.git
```
<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/2.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/2.png"></a>
	<figcaption>Click the copy icon to copy the URL</figcaption>
</figure>

### Download the Repository

1. Open terminal on your computer, paste in he following command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
```
git clone <replace_with_repository_url>
```
1. Make sure it succeeded and there's a folder in your folder. You can check by typing the following command:
```
ls -l
```
1. Now, switch to GitHub Desktop sign in and add the project folder you just cloned into
<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/3.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/3.png"></a>
	<figcaption>Click on "Add Existing Repository"</figcaption>
</figure>
1. Finally, link your new repository to the project we just created. Visit this link and replace `<your_username>`:
```
https://github.com/users/<your_username>/projects/1/settings/linked_repositories
```

### Push your code changes

1. Swtich to GitHub Desktop and create a new branch called `gen-food`
<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/4.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/4.png"></a>
	<figcaption>Click on "Click on new branch to create the new branch"</figcaption>
</figure>
1. Remember the code you have from `particle-simulator`? For now, just open up your editor and copy it over to your new project folder.
1. In GitHub Desktop, write a summary click `Commit to gen-food` near the bottom and click `Push Origin` next to the branch tab.
1. Now visit your repository's URL on your browser to see that your code has been updated.

## Challenge 2: Project Manage this project

### Create a New Project

1. Create a [New Project](https://github.com/new/project)
1. Select the `Automated kanban with reviews` project template.
1. Link the `agar-io` repository we just created.
1. Read the example cards to see what you can do with them.
1. Click on `Archive all cards` to remove all cards from each column.
<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/1.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/1.png"></a>
	<figcaption>We don't need all these cards.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Create Cards / Tickets

1. Create cards for each bullet point under the **Goals** section in the "To Do" column by hitting the <kbd>+</kbd> button.
1. Convert each card to an issue by selecting `Convert to Issue` on the card.

## Challenge 3: Implement the Code

### Example Task

Let's pick generating food periodically from the **Goals** section as the first task to take on. We'll break it down even more to get you started:

- Create a new Food class
- Generate Food objects instead of Circle objects
- Run the generate code periodically

When you finish creating the Food class, push your code again. It's a way of saving progress online so you won't lose your work if your computer fell from a helicopter. Make all the changes you need to ensure the goal has been accomplished.

### Make a Pull Request (PR for short)

We make pull requests in order to compare the differences between branches. This is the place where your peer look at your work and help you discover problems before they make it to the main branch - i.e. the real world. You will outline your changes and prove that it works by demonstrating the functionality through screenshots and logs of you testing the code.

1. Click "New Pull Request" to create a new pull request
<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/5.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/5.png"></a>
	<figcaption>Click on "Create a new pull request"</figcaption>
</figure>

1. Use the following template to write your pull request

{% highlight markdown %}
# Context
_What and why?_

# Acceptance Criteria
_What needs to be accomplished before we consider it to be complete?_
- [ ] The system must behaves this way
```
Screenshots, logs, explanations...
```

# Changes Summary
_What are the main changes?_
- Implemented `SoAndSoFunc()`
- Added unit tests
- ...

# Links
_What are some helpful links to enrich the context?_
- Tech Spec: https://docs.my-grate-company.com/some-tech-spec
- User Story: https://docs.my-grate-company.com/some-user-story
{% endhighlight %}

### Link Pull Request to Project

1. On the right panel, go to "Linked Issues" and select the appropriate issue for this pull request.
1. Also on the right panel, set reviewers, assignee, projects and labels as well. We will revisit milestone when we have a bigger project.
1. Go back to your Project dashboard to see what changed. Replace `<your_username>` in the link:
```
https://github.com/users/<your_username>/projects/1
```
<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/6.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/6.png"></a>
	<figcaption>Congrats! You are now your own project manager.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Review and Merge Changes

Once your code is deemed ready. Ask your peer to review your changes. You will see pull requests in the [review requested tab](https://github.com/pulls/review-requested) when someone requests a review from you. I'll host a web application that match you with people just like you to form teams and have you create something together. You may not have one now so you can review it yourself for now.

When reviewing code, you can click on the "Files changed" tab of the pull request and click on the blue <kbd>+</kbd> sign that appears when you hover over a line of code to annotate that line of code:
<figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/7.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/projects/agar-io/7.png"></a>
	<figcaption>Click on "Writing comments"</figcaption>
</figure>

If you are done reviewing the code for now, you can decide to "Approve", "Comment" or "Request Changes". You should wait until a pull request is approved before merging. In real life, this can be configured to be enforced.

Code must be tested and reviewed before being merged.
{: .notice}

If you forget to merge before starting another PR on a different branch, you may run into _code conflicts_. This generally only happens when you work with someone else on the same parts of the code.

Code conflict is the symptom of inevitable imperfection of planning & collaboration.
{: .notice}

## The Whole Process

This summarizes the process so you don't have to dig through the tutorial again.

### Implementer Perspective

1. Create branch
1. Make PR
1. Update & Push code
1. Request Review
1. Repeat step 3. until approved
1. Merge PR

### Reviewer Perspective

1. Review code with comments
1. Request changes
1. Repeat 1. until the code is fully tested and is free of problems
1. Approve changes

# Conclusion

There is a lot to take in. Take a deep breath. As you can see, writing code is just a small part of being a software engineer. Fortunately, this covers a lot of what you will do day to day. A lot of it is just being able to follow instructions, looking things up and making incremental changes in the codebase. This is what you learned if you completed the project:

1. You have a practical understanding on version control and software development process.
1. You implemented code from a tech spec with imperfect information.
1. You can intuitively look up resources outside of this guide to overcame programming challenges.

This concludes the beginner tutorial of this course. We can now get into some real stuff.
