# Let's Recreate Agar.IO

In the real workplace, you'll be asked to read a tech spec and implement code. Your assignment is to do so with the following tech spec. Good luck!

# Recreate Agar.IO Tech Spec

## Summary
_The **Summary** section summarizes the goal._

Agar.IO is fun and gets fairly complex. You will be implementing a simple version of it.

## Context
_The **Context** section tells us why we are doing what we are doing and what we have already done to build upon our goals._

The next step is to create a one of the Agar.IO to prove to yourself you have learned. There will be no help or hints, just you and the universe. You should reflect on your *accomplishments* and take inspiration from the concepts and tools from this project. You can [play Agar.IO here](https://www.miniclip.com/games/agar-io/en/) to understand the basic mechanics.

## Goals
_The **Goals** section outlines the objectives of this tech spec before we consider the project complete. This is also known as **Acceptance Criteria**_

- Create a blob that gets bigger when it eats food
- Allow the blob to move around based on user controls
- Periodically generate food around the blob
- The blob will grow smaller as it waits or moves around
- The blob dies when it gets too small and turns grey

## Non-Goals
_The **Non-Goals** section help confine the scope of the project so that we do not over-shoot and implement things that may not be used._

- Making the camera center around the blob
- Create enemies that you can eat and can eat you

## Plan
_The **Plan** section describes roughly how the goals should be accomplished and documents how things should work._

We will use HTML canvas and create this game with JavaScript. The following are classes that will help shape the mechanics and world-building of the game.

### Game
```
  Attributes:
    objects - contains the blob and the food
    foodGenRate - how many foods should be generated per time unit
  Methods:
    render() - remove destroyed objects and invokes draw on each objects
    generateFood() - adds foods to its object attribute periodically
    garbageCollect() - removes destroyed objects so they do not take up memory
```

### Circle
```
  Attributes:
    size - size of the circle
    color - color of the circle
    destroyed - a boolean that indicates the object should no longer be drawn and be removed from the objects attribute
  Methods:
    draw() - draws the blob onto the canvas
```

### Blob
```
  Parent Class:
    Circle
  Attributes:
    size - how big the blob is visually
    metabolicRate - how fast the size decreases
    velocity - how fast it can move
    position - where it is on the canvas
    direction - where it is going towards
  Methods:
    eat(obj) - takes an object as a parameter
      1. Checks if the object can be eaten
      1. Checks collision with the object
      1. Mark the object as destroyed
    metabolize() - decreases size based on metabolicRate, when it is too small, it turns grey and stops metabolizing
    updatePosition() - update the position of the object
```

### Food
```
  Parent Class:
    Circle
  Attributes:
    canBeEaten - a boolean that indicates the object can be eaten
```

---

### Controls

- Make the blob follow the mouse by changing its direction towards the mouse

### Generating Food

- Generate foods at random spots at a given rate

Hint: You may want to use [setInterval()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp)

## Security
_The **Security** section does not apply to this project. In general, it highlights security risks and how we can mitigate them. we must think as attackers to break, steal, and monitor our victims, and as defenders, to frustrate attackers._

## Scalability
_The **Scalability** section also does not apply to this project. In general, scalability is determined by the anticipated utility with margins and limited by performance characteristics. This is a good place to include graphs to prove that this tech spec proposal can scale._

## Other Considerations
_The **Other Considerations** section consist of ideas that we thought about but decided not to go with. It shows that we have thought about these ideas and help answer questions that may arise in the **Discussion** section._

- I decided not to ask you to create this document yourself as it may be too difficult. I will be more hands off as you gain more skills, experience and confidence.
- We will not yet simulate other parts of the development process here because that requires more set up and it distracts from the assignment itself.

## Discussion
_The **Discussion** section allows collaborators to ask for clarification and/or make suggestions. This will help shape and clean up the whole tech spec. I will prompt you and your peer to start Dropbox documents in upcoming projects. Instead of this section, we can leverage the annotation feature in these documents._

## Staying Organized

Sign up for [GitHub here](https://github.com/). We will be using this for version control and project management.

### Version Control

_Version Control_ is tool to help keep changes in code organized in a collaborative environment. You want to know the exact version of the code that people are running when they use your app. You may have changes that is not done and it's helpful to deploy these changes when they are complete and tested. You may want to see your code from a few days ago to understand why something did or didn't work. There are many more reasons, you will gain them through experience with this course. There is no need to memorize these reasons if you think they'll ask you in an interview.

### Project Management

You should know about _Project Management_ even though you are not a project manager because this is a system that you need to use on a day to day basis.
