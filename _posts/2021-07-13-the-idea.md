# Let's build a social network

I am bored. Let's build a social network.

## Write the Idea Down

### In one sentence

A hub to develop your life's paths - not just your career.

### The Problem (Statement)

- I am not doing what I want and I'm a wage-slave.
- How do I get a job without experience?
- Interviews are stupid.
- People at my work don't even know what they are doing.
- Execs are toxic af.

### Potential Solutions

- **Micro-Economy**: The idea is that anyone can be a paid contributor of the platform. They can propose project ideas and people can vote to fund the projects they care about. Their earnings will then be allocated to fund projects that reaches a threshold of alignment and popularity. Contributors will also be rewarded small weighted amount of stock equity from **all** projects. It lowers the risk of failure and increase the rewards for everyone because no one ever needs to be filthy rich. It decreases competition and increases collaboration within particular industries.

- **Degrees and Certifications**: Professionals can organically evaluate the efficacy for degrees, tests and certifications so that education doesn't have to be centered around traditional "prestigeous" university education which leads to inflationary systemic injustice. Also, it will serve as a platform where universities and organization use as an official registry to issue degrees and certifications.

- **Anonymized Reviews**: Anonymizing reviews between peers, managers and organizations provides insights to people's hard/soft skills, growth, interests, attributions and culture. This applies to schools, organizations and companies so you can start building verifiable experience before you enter the workforce. Try figuring this out all just from a resume and some interviews seems inpractical.

## Evaluate the Idea

Obviously, this is too ambitious. Let's just do the minimum - minimum viable product or MVP. Wait, I think I skipped a step. Do people even want this? Normally, you'll have to find out first. How?

### Are other people already doing it?

- Actually, it doesn't matter.
- Can you do better tho?

### Do people want it?

- Do surveys. It's not that helpful but can be good if you put some serious effort in making one.
- Ask potential customers. It answers what surveys can't.
- Make a website, advertise it and see how many people sign-up for emailing list.

### Can you [Make It Happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JHYLAIyPvs)?

- Do you have enough following? Build one. Start a YouTube channel, IG, and everything else.
- Do you have people to build this with you?
- Can you get away without asking for funding?

### Is this a good idea?

- Is it a _no_ at this rate? Think of another idea, repeat this process.

## Draw the Idea

It is crucial to see the idea in action. Otherwise, you are all talk. The best way today is to use **Figma**. You can learn more in the [Design Principles post]({{ site.url }}/design-principles). The project idea is quite broad, we must only focus on one thing and do that well. Sit down with someone time and time to get their feedback. I built a mock-up which will be linked in the next post.
