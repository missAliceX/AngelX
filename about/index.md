# A Free 12-Week Collaborative Bootcamp

If you want to get that Silicone Valley pay grade (USD \$100k+/yr), work with smart people or build cool things, follow along. I will help you become well rounded and help you make informed decisions on specialization. Buckle up and join me in this tech journey!

## Why not just online degrees or college?

Generally, employers believe in college education, especially larger companies, but less so in software engineering. You will know from reading their job description and benefits what kind of employer they are. Some are more receptive You want to anchor your life on your skills, not your employer. You can build real experiences and skills here for free so why bother paying for college or online degrees?

- You will have a **project running live** on your portfolio
- Call it **1-2 years of experience** on your resume.
- Most bootcamps and colleges typically focus on forgettable trivia instead of real life skills.
- The author works as a full-time employee at a FAANG company.
- This is **free**, duh.

## Simulates real workplace

How much were you able to memorize in school and how much did you use in real life? You cannot understand something fully without practicing it. We are building knowledge, not real skills. We will together simulate what it is like to work in a real workplace. Also, you will build realistic software infrastructures and development pipelines. This is something that online courses or college cannot give you.

- Simulates working with other engineers, designers and managers.
- Use and build real infrastructures, pipelines, and tools.

## Capstone project with your match-made team

There will be a web application that helps match-make teams to create a start-up from start to finish as the capstone project of this course. If your team turns out to be baller, you may not even need to work for anyone after this but most start-ups fail so chances are low. However, finding a job will be easier with a portfolio that will be considered as real life experience.

## Discover Your Path

Do you know what you like before trying it? Don't think so. Through these projects, you will find out what you like and your strengths, which may be different. I will create more projects to cater to you so you can get the career path you want:

- Frontend Engineer
- Backend Engineer
- Fullstack Engineer
- Data Engineer/Scientist
- Development Security Operations (DevOps)
- UX Designer

## Interview Preparation

Companies generally have contrived interview processes focused on algorithms and architecture, which is nothing like real software engineering. This course will have a section focused on getting good at passing interviews.

## What's the catch?

No way it's free and more comprehensive than everything else. The catch is I want to build a company off of this, I will name the first problem I want to solve:

- Interviewing is the only way to access someone's competence, knowledge, work ethics, and inter-personal skills which is even less apparent for new grads.

I haven't built it yet, but you can be a fan and give me your email to let me know you are interested.

I am a full-time employee for one of the FAANGs. I wish to be anonymous for now. There will be an easter egg where you can hack my accounts to find out who I am!
