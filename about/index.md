# A Dynamic Online Course

If you want to get that Silicone Valley pay grade (USD \$100k starting), work with smart people or build cool things, follow along. I will help you become well rounded and decide what you want to specialize in. Buckle up and join me in this tech journey!

# Why not bootcamp or go to college?

## Simulates real workplace

How much were you able to memorize in school and how much did you use in real life? You cannot understand something fully without practicing it. We are building knowledge, not real skills. We will together simulate what it is like to work in a real workplace.

- Toy projects and then with practical projects with realistic software infrastructures.
- Matches you with a buddy / team to collaborate on projects and review each other's work.

## Team Match-Making

There will be a web application that helps match-make teams to create a start-up from start to finish as the capstone project of this course. You will be able to backup your experience with hard, cold numbers. If your team turns out to be baller, you may not even need to work for anyone after this but most start-ups fail so chances are low. However, finding a job will be much easier than getting an education or doing a bootcamp because employers do not count those.

## Catered to Your Specialization

Do you know what you like before trying it? Don't think so. Through these projects, you will find out what you like and your strengths, which may be different. I will create more projects to cater to you so you can get the career path you want:

- Frontend Engineer
- Backend Engineer
- Fullstack Engineer
- Data Engineer/Scientist
- Development Security Operations (DevOps)
- UX Designer

## Interview and Certification

Generally, employers believe in college education but less so in software engineering and they definitely do not prefer bootcamp. You will not know how they hire unless there is a public announcement from the company, like Tesla. Do not waste too much time researching about the company before an interview. You want to anchor your life on your skills, not your employer. You can build skill here for free so why bother paying for college or bootcamps?
